# Roam Power Previewer

This extension can preview a website content in the sidedrawer, which gives a better roam experience - neat clean notes and easiy preview the website content without going out of roam, to help you focus more in the roam.

This extension's whole idea is to let you stay in roam to focus on your work without going out and meanwhile keep you roam notes clean, without too much blocks nested within which could disturb a lot.

For now, it can only preview the website content, but in the feature, I tend to have more contents in the roam can be previewed in the same way. Reach me out if you have any feature request.

`Note That`
If you don't want to preview the website content in the sidedrawer or sometimes the website you are tring to preview has a iframe securty policy which forbids to do so, then you can simply press the following keys(`ctrl`, `meta`, `shift`) when click the link, to view the website in the browser
